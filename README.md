# Py-Keyboard-Class
A class used for handling inputs via VK codes and win32 API moved from Helper/curses.py. The Keyboard class can send inputs via functions like `scrollMouse`, `pressAndReleaseKey`, `keyboardWrite` and `pressAndReleaseMouse` it can also return keystrokes using the `GetKeystroke` wrapper which polls key presses. This project can send keyboard and mouse inputs on windows for anything.
